    <p>Programming game AI is an interesting challenge. It is a balance of making something challenging, but not impossible. You rarely want to your AI to play <a href="https://youtu.be/3PLplRDSgpo">perfectly</a> otherwise you're player is helpless against it. In that video, we see what a computer can do with minute control over units in SC2. These AIs are specifically meant to beat the best players at the game and they often do it by controlling units to literally dodge bullets. In the time it takes the bullet to travel from the shooter to the unit, the computer has hidden the unit away, entirely avoiding damage. That is fine detail control that would be impossible, for me at least, to replicate.</p>
        
    <p>How should an AI be programmed? Well it needs to be able to miss. In my opinion, the best AI are ones that the player can learn to fight well and that the player can dodge. A boss or enemy should never require the player to use a min/max build or bug-exploit to win. On the flip side, I do appreciate it when games have an extreme player hate difficulty that typically requires a combination of perfect play and exploits to win against. It gives the community something to crowd source into submission.</p>

    <p>One game that gets the difficulty curve terribly wrong is Skyrim. Difficulty in Skyrim entirely means the enemies simultaneously hit really hard and have bottomless pools of health. On easy, you can't die and one shot everything. On legendary (I think that's the hardest difficulty), you cheese the AI so it gets stuck while you shoot it with 50 arrows. It means boss fights are actually just how good are you at running in circles in a first person shooter, because there aren't really any mechanics for you to dodge.</p>

    <p>In contrast to that are two games that I think actually get the difficulty curve right: Unreal Tournament 2004 and Deep Rock Galactic. What I like about Unreal Tournament 2004 is that the difference between the discrete difficulty levels is noticeable from the bottom to the top and their is a level that most players will feel comfortable playing against (unless they are really good already). The AI in that game also does not cheat, it simply gets better at aiming and dodging, which back in the Quake-style shooter was a thing you could actually do (as opposed to modern Call of Duty-style shooters, which are more about positioning than dodging).</p>

    <p>Finally, in Deep Rock Galactic, the difficulty is driven mostly by amount of enemy, type of enemy, and other hazards present. On the higher difficulties, more enemies spawn, which is perfect in a game about mowing down swarms of insect-like aliens. Also, more difficult enemies spawn. For example, one enemy that spawns rarely on low difficulties is the exploder enemy, essentially a suicide bomber. On all difficulties, it can one-hit-kill you if you're not careful. Also, it dies in about two hits. However, if you're suddenly faced with a dozen of them, when you normally expect 2 or 3, the game feels much more difficult, while still not leaving the player feeling powerless. Things to keep in mind when programming my own AI in the games I build.</p>
