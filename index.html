<p>My name is Andrew Sanville. Welcome to my website. A lot of it is currently under construction as I learn more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python as part of the <a href="https://kickstartcoding.com/">KickStart Coding bootcamp</a>. Feel free to explore and see what all I've put together. Let's change the world through code!</p>
