<p>This is intended to be a blog page as part of my first assignment as part of the <a href="https://kickstartcoding.com/">KickStart Coding bootcamp</a>. I'm still learning a bunch (I've done 1 of 48 lessons, hurray!) and so everything that looks good on this website is from templates.</p>

<p>Anyway, in my heart and soul, I'm an algorithms/backend guy and thinking about writing a blog, makes me want to build a blog. If I'm being honest, I have no business trying this right now as I've really just started playing around with HTML (let alone CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Python, and whatever else I'll need). Based on <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/335925/do-i-store-blog-posts-in-a-database-and-how-do-i-continue-to-make-posts">this post</a> on Stack Exchange, it seems a common way to do the backend is with something called a Content Management System. The idea is that an SQL database stores a bunch of blog posts and content as text and feeds and then the CMS feeds it to the website in the correct place. I'm actually pretty interested in learning how exactly this works and attempting to implement something like this myself.</p>

<p>As an easy bad first solution, I imagine I could just make an html file for each blog post and store it along with the contents of this website, pulling it in and putting it in the proper place. I could also just treat it like a string in a text file and just concatenate it into the proper place in the webpage. I honestly don't know if that's even possible, but I'm still learning so I guesss I will find out. A more advanced solution would let me create a formatted article in my favorite word processor and store it in more blog friendly way. I know, for example, that Microsoft Word let's you freely create HTML files out of word documents. I will also have to figure out hosting all of this stuff... seems like a lack of knowledge problem that will be solved as I learn more.</p>

<p>Seeing as I know nothing about constructing dynamic webpages nor do I know anything about SQL, I'm probably going to wait on making something more complicated than raw content in HTML. Hurray for static webpages.</p>
