            <p>This is intended to be a blog page as part of my first assignment as part of the <a
                href="https://kickstartcoding.com/">KickStart Coding bootcamp</a>. I'm still learning a bunch (I've done
            1
            of 48 lessons, hurray!) and so everything that looks good on this website is from templates.</p>

        <p>Anyway, in my heart and soul, I'm an algorithms/backend guy and thinking about writing a blog, makes me want
            to
            build a blog. If I'm being honest, I have no business trying this right now as I've really just started
            playing
            around with HTML (let alone CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Python, and whatever else I'll need). Based on <a
                href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/335925/do-i-store-blog-posts-in-a-database-and-how-do-i-continue-to-make-posts">this
                post</a> on Stack Exchange, it seems a common way to do the backend is with something called a Content
            Management System. The idea is that an SQL database stores a bunch of blog posts and content as text and
            feeds
            and then the CMS feeds it to the website in the correct place. I'm actually pretty interested in learning
            how
            exactly this works and attempting to implement something like this myself.</p>

        <p>As an easy bad first solution, I imagine I could just make an html file for each blog post and store it along
            with the contents of this website, pulling it in and putting it in the proper place. I could also just treat
            it
            like a string in a text file and just concatenate it into the proper place in the webpage. I honestly don't
            know
            if that's even possible, but I'm still learning so I guesss I will find out. A more advanced solution would
            let
            me create a formatted article in my favorite word processor and store it in more blog friendly way. I know,
            for
            example, that Microsoft Word let's you freely create HTML files out of word documents. I will also have to
            figure out hosting all of this stuff... seems like a lack of knowledge problem that will be solved as I
            learn
            more.</p>

        <p>Seeing as I know nothing about constructing dynamic webpages nor do I know anything about SQL, I'm probably
            going
            to wait on making something more complicated than raw content in HTML. Hurray for static webpages.</p>
