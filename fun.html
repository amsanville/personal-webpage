<h1>Fun!</h1>
<p>I've collected here some of the more technical things that I like to do for fun in when I find myself with some free time.</p>
<h2>Project Euler</h2>
<p>Project Euler is a collection of a wide variety of math and programming problems publically posted for anyone to try and solve. One thing that I really enjoy about Project Euler is the variety. I love poking into new branches of math or programming and seeing what's out there and how proofs are done. I've collected here some of the solutions I've made to some of the problems.</p>

<p>For many of the problems, there is a brute force computation way of doing it and there is a mathematical proof way of doing it. Usually I'll try a crack at both and see what I come up with. A really great example of what I mean, the first question asks to sum up all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. This is a finite discrete problem that has an easy solution with for loop (see <a href="./project_euler_1.py" download>project_euler_1.py</a>). Alternatively, a solution for any <em>i</em>, <em>j</em>, and <em>k</em> can be found (<em>i</em> = 3, <em>j</em> = 5, and <em>k</em> = 1000 in this case) using Gauss's sum formula and some additional caveats (see <a href="./project_euler_1.pdf" download>project_euler_1.pdf</a> for formal proof).</p>

<p>In this table, I've collected my solutions with links to download proofs/algorithm descriptions and the respective Python scripts.</p>
<h2>Code Wars</h2>
<p>One thing that I actually really enjoy is writing solutions to small bite-sized algorithms, like those found in the technical challenges of some interviews. In addition to Project Euler, I use Code Wars for more problems. One thing I like about Code Wars is that it allows you to see other people's solutions. This means I can view some of the tips and tricks that are inherent in different languages.</p>

<h2>Data Structures and Algorithms</h2>
<p>Probably my favorite part of learning to code was object oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms. There are so many fascinating problems that are easily solved by applying the correct coding structure to them. I find that I learn best by doing, so I've collected a bunch of different algorithms/structures I'm recreating in C++. These include numerical algorithms, like ODE solvers and root searching algorithms, data structures, sorts, and searches. Check it out on my <a href="https://github.com/amsanville/DataStructuresAndAlgorithms">C++ algorithms repo</a> on GitHub.</p>
