        <p>I've collected here some of the more technical things that I like to do for fun in when I find myself with
            some
            free time.</p>
        <h2>Project Euler</h2>
        <p>Project Euler is a collection of a wide variety of math and programming problems publically posted for anyone
            to
            try and solve. One thing that I really enjoy about Project Euler is the variety. I love poking into new
            branches
            of math or programming and seeing what's out there and how proofs are done. I've collected here some of the
            solutions I've made to some of the problems.</p>

        <p>For many of the problems, there is a brute force computation way of doing it and there is a mathematical
            proof
            way of doing it. Usually I'll try a crack at both and see what I come up with. A really great example of
            what I
            mean, the first question asks to sum up all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. This is a finite discrete
            problem that has an easy solution with for loop (see <a href="./project_euler_1.py"
                download>project_euler_1.py</a>). Alternatively, a solution for any <em>i</em>, <em>j</em>, and
            <em>k</em>
            can be found (<em>i</em> = 3, <em>j</em> = 5, and <em>k</em> = 1000 in this case) using Gauss's sum formula
            and
            some additional caveats (see <a href="./project_euler_1.pdf" download>project_euler_1.pdf</a> for formal
            proof).
        </p>

        <p>In this table, I've collected my solutions with links to download proofs/algorithm descriptions and the
            respective Python scripts.</p>
        <table class="table">

        <h2>Code Wars</h2>
        <p>One thing that I actually really enjoy is writing solutions to small bite-sized algorithms, like those found
            in
            the technical challenges of some interviews. In addition to Project Euler, I use Code Wars for more
            problems.
            One thing I like about Code Wars is that it allows you to see other people's solutions. This means I can
            view
            some of the tips and tricks that are inherent in different languages.</p>

        <h2>Data Structures and Algorithms</h2>
        <p>Probably my favorite part of learning to code was object oriented programming, data structures, and
            algorithms.
            There are so many fascinating problems that are easily solved by applying the correct coding structure to
            them.
            I find that I learn best by doing, so I've collected a bunch of different algorithms/structures I'm
            recreating
            in C++. These include numerical algorithms, like ODE solvers and root searching algorithms, data structures,
            sorts, and searches. Check it out on my <a
                href="https://github.com/amsanville/DataStructuresAndAlgorithms">C++
                algorithms repo</a> on GitHub.</p>
