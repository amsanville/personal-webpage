                <p>Hi! My name is Andrew Sanville. For a little
                    background, I grew up in Minnesota, completed my undergraduate degree at UW-Madison in applied
                    mathematics, and moved to California for graduate school at UC-Berkeley in computational fluid
                    dynamics in the mechanical engineering department. I left my PhD program after I realized research
                    did not interest me as a career. Currently, I'm working through a temp agency while I complete the
                    <a href="https://kickstartcoding.com/">KickStart Coding bootcamp</a> in
                    order to change careers. Over the years, I've come to realize I have a passion for solving problems
                    usingmathematics and programming. There is something distinctly satisfying about watching all the
                    pieces of a proof or algorithm come together (check out the <a href="./fun.html">Fun</a> page for
                    some stuff I've gotten up to). In my free time, I enjoy exploring the outdoors (picture shown is
                    from sunrise at the top of Kilimanjaro) and playing and, now, creating videogames. In fact, I've
                    started learning C# to write scripts in Unity as well as building an engine from scratch in C++
                    (using <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL2</a> to do graphical output).</p>

        <p>As for my education and training, I'm an applied mathematician with a background in computational physics
            focusing on computational fluid dynamics. That means I've spent a lot of time using computers to numerically
            model partial differential equations (PDEs), focusing mostly on a form of the Navier-Stokes Equation (think
            of it as Newton's Second Law of Motion for fluids) in a special form called the Anelastic Equations.
            Practically, what that means, is I've written a bunch of MatLab code meant to prototype FORTRAN code to be run on super
            computer systems using MPI (message passing interface) or that outright solves different PDEs using various
            methods.</p>

        <p>During my time as an undergraduate, I first learned to code using MatLab in a small course on scientific
            computing that taught engineering students how to use Maple (a different flavor of Mathematica) and MatLab.
            Later on, I took several formal programming courses in Java, and rounded out my undergraduate career by
            learning
            C++ to do scientific computing on super computers. As part of a some senior research work, I learned
            FORTRAN. As
            it turns out engineering codes, like those used at NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmophseric Administration) to
            model the weather, are projects older than I am and are written in FORTRAN. Finally, in my graduate work, I
            branched out to learn some Python to replace MatLab, as Python is, by far, the more popular and thus
            practical
            language to know. All of this is to say, I've played around a lot in different programming languages and am
            eager and willing to learn more if needed. C++ will always have a special place in my heart.</p>
