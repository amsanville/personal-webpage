# My Page
My personal webpage currently built through a static site generator (SSG) using Jinja 2 templating.

Note:
* Blog contains the blog entries as html files stored on the date of their creation.
* Content contains the html for the navbar pages
* Docs contains all the final formatted docs as well as any files they link to.

Feel free to play around with the SSG. Running:
```bash
python manage.py
```
will give a list of commands on how to use the generator.
