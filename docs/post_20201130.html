    <p>This is intended to be a blog page as part of my first assignment as part of the <a
            href="https://kickstartcoding.com/">KickStart Coding bootcamp</a>. I'm still learning a bunch (I've
        done
        1
        of 48 lessons, hurray!) and so everything that looks good on this website is from templates.</p>

    <p>Anyway, in my heart and soul, I'm an algorithms/backend guy and thinking about writing a blog, makes me
        want
        to
        build a blog. If I'm being honest, I have no business trying this right now as I've really just started
        playing
        around with HTML (let alone CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Python, and whatever else I'll need). Based on <a
            href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/335925/do-i-store-blog-posts-in-a-database-and-how-do-i-continue-to-make-posts">this
            post</a> on Stack Exchange, it seems a common way to do the backend is with something called a
        Content
        Management System. The idea is that an SQL database stores a bunch of blog posts and content as text and
        feeds
        and then the CMS feeds it to the website in the correct place. I'm actually pretty interested in
        learning
        how
        exactly this works and attempting to implement something like this myself.</p>

    <p>As an easy bad first solution, I imagine I could just make an html file for each blog post and store it
        along
        with the contents of this website, pulling it in and putting it in the proper place. I could also just
        treat
        it
        like a string in a text file and just concatenate it into the proper place in the webpage. I honestly
        don't
        know
        if that's even possible, but I'm still learning so I guesss I will find out. A more advanced solution
        would
        let
        me create a formatted article in my favorite word processor and store it in more blog friendly way. I
        know,
        for
        example, that Microsoft Word let's you freely create HTML files out of word documents. I will also have
        to
        figure out hosting all of this stuff... seems like a lack of knowledge problem that will be solved as I
        learn
        more.</p>

    <p>Seeing as I know nothing about constructing dynamic webpages nor do I know anything about SQL, I'm
        probably
        going
        to wait on making something more complicated than raw content in HTML. Hurray for static webpages.</p>
