    <p>Well, I guess I did it. I made a blog page populator (see <a href="./20201130.html">this post</a>). I wrote a python script that populates the main blog splash page with my most recent post. Also made it auto-construct an archive (seen to the left). The idea is that every time I write a blog post, I can update my page by adding the post to a list of all posts and then a python script will update the site to reflect the changes. So hurray!</p>

    <p>The way the script works is that it uses the date of the post as a key for each post. Since I do not see myself writing multiple posts per date, I can use it as a unique number. Also, since dates are sequential, I can easily sort the blog posts chronologically. The idea is that the content of each post is a file named "YYYYMMDD.html". This can then be fed into a template by Python. The archive is populated from a sorted list of all such posts with the most recent post being the one that shows up on the "Blog" link in the navbar. </p>
        
    <p>The next new features I would like to implement are drop down menus in the archive. Right now, since there are like three posts (this being the third), it's pretty easy to scroll through and see all the posts. However, I would like to organize them by year and then month, with little arrows that you click to reveal all the posts.</p>

    <p>Another layer of organization that might be good is topic. "Last Podcast on the Left", a podcast about serial killers, cults, and the occult, actually has an organization structure that I <a href="://www.lastpodcastontheleft.com/#archive-section">reasonably like</a>. In order to do this piece of it, I would have to tag the posts with some set of tags. Then I could create a topics archive based on the tags.</p>
    
    <p>Right now, the blog is built from a list of dates, that are the same as the content files and then final pages. In addition to this integer date, I could store the tags as a list of strings. I then create a master list of strings that are all the unique topics, then under each topic the dated and titled posts are organized, putting the most recent at the top. Finally, to make the archive not too cumbersome to navigate, these would further be put under collapseable menus like the above. Food for thought once I learn how to do stuff like that.</p>
